  <h1>第 2 节感谢信：核心并不是感谢</h1>
  <p>提笔写感谢信之前<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>请大家换位思考一下这几个问题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.面试官是期待着你的感谢信<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>还是有点害怕你的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>骚扰<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.面试官会因为你的感谢而感动吗<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.如果面试官不得不收一封感谢信<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他会希望收到什么样的感谢信呢<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答这几个问题其实非常容易<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>面试官对于公式化的感谢信其实一点也不感冒<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他们既不期待着你的感谢<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也不会因为你的感谢而感动<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>只有那些幽默或者优美的感谢信<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>能够让他们在欣赏你的文字之余给你的申请加上一分<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我负责招聘工作的时候<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>经常收到大家在面试之后发来的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Thank you letter<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>我发现<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这样的感谢信往往能够给我留下比较好的印象<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.开篇<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>以诙谐幽默的一两句话让我回忆起候选人是谁<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.第二段<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>利用面试中发生的一个细节或者小插曲<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>感谢或夸奖一下我<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>或者发表一下感想<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.第三段<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>把自己的缺点弥补一下<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.第四段<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>再次强调一下自己的优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.最后<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>表达加入该团队的渴望<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>并表达自己的祝福<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>从上面的描述中<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你可以看出<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>感谢信的核心并不是感谢<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而是夸奖对方<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>然后弥补自己在面试中表现出的不足<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>并再次自夸<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>现在<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>请大家欣赏一封漂亮的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Thank you letter<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-mail 标题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>很抱歉<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>偷<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>了您的签字笔<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>标题最好要引人注目<span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>冬寒乍起<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>希望您保重身体<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>拥有一个温暖的冬季<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>以下是该感谢信的英文版<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject:Sorry to have<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>stolen<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>your pen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Tracy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is Li Yuan<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>李园<span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>who had the interview with you this morning.I just realized that I<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>stole<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>your pen<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>Sorry about that, and I wish I can have a chance to return it to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In those many interviews I had at other training centers, never has any interviewer impressed me like you did, because you were willing to share your precious experiences with me about how to be a qualified teacher. I was deeply touched, and realized once again that high quality people are never afraid to share.Those who work with you now are indeed very lucky!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You expressed your concern about my lack of experience, which was exactly the area I am eager to improve. Right after the talk with you, I bought a whiteboard, set up my digital camera, began my trial teaching at home!I´ve decided to do at least 5 trial teaching every day, recorded them to find out the weaknesses for improvement.I believe I can accumulate the much needed experiences in this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the interview I took a look at the textbooks of<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Interview English<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>and<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Business Oral English<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>as you mentioned they might be suitable for me. To my happy surprise, they are!I feel confident that I can use my experiences of working in foreign firms in teaching to help students learn faster!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really look forward to joining your team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It´s cold winter outside, I hope you take care and have a warm season!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best wishes,&nbsp;</p>
