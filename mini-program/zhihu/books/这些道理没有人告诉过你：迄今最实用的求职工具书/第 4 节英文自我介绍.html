  <h1>第 4 节英文自我介绍</h1>
  <p>对于英语好的同学<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>英文自我介绍可能是亮点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>但是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>对于很多哑巴英语患者<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>英文自我介绍就可能成为弱点……所以<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>提前准备好尤为重要<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>关于英文自我介绍的几个疑问 &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.英文自我介绍<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>要考察求职者什么<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>英文自我介绍有几种不同类型<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>该公司官方语言为英语<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这种情况下<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>考察目的只有一个<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>你匹配该职位吗<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>该公司官方语言为汉语<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是经常要用到英语<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这种自我介绍考察的往往是你的英文能力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以你要更加注意吐字清晰<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>言简意赅<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>易于听懂<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.多长时间的英文自我介绍最合适<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>一般来说<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>面对中国面试官的英文自我介绍可以简短一些<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>常速朗读时间控制在 1 分钟到 1.5 分钟之间比较合适<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为简短一些的自我介绍可以让中国面试官更加容易记住你说的话<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>针对外国面试官的英文自我介绍可以稍微长一点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>以常速介绍 1.5 分钟到 2 分钟为宜<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为你必然需要做一些关于人名或地名的解释<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.面试官喜欢什么样的英文自我介绍<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>一般来说<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>具有以下特点的英文自我介绍符合面试官的期望值<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>短句<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>尽量使用口语化的短句<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>易于面试官听懂<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>慢速<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>比中文自我介绍速度要放慢至少三分之一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>易于面试官放松地倾听<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>强调<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>在你需要面试官重点倾听的地方要用语调和语气加以强调<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>易于让面试官抓住重点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My English name is Mandy, m-a-n-d-y, I wonder if there´re already other Mandy-s in Nestle, because this is a very popular name with Chinese girls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will soon graduate from China Agriculture University, but my major is not related to agriculture, I´ve studied international economics and trade. I like my major a lot so I´ve got a very good academic performance.My GPA ranks No.3 in the class of 60 students.Besides studying I am also an important member of the Student Union of our university and was awarded the honor of Excellent Student Cadre by our school.Outside the campus I did some practice jobs.You may have noticed that one of them was in Coco Cola as a part time Promotion Assistant.I was then working in Vanguard Supermarket to promote the drink<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Cool<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>or Ku-er in Chinese.It was a very tiring job, because I had to wear the heavy overall of cartoon bear for eight hours a day and jumped around to attract the attention of children.But I did it quite well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I´m interested in Nestle because this is a great food and beverag.company, and as a graduate from an agriculture university I have a natural interest in Nestle. Besides interest, I am sure I have the potential to be a great sales rep.<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>because firstly I love Nestle products, I´ve been a loyal customer of Nestle coffee for years, and secondly I have the necessary qualities of a good sales, you know.communications skills, passion, not afraid of being rejected and so on.These abilities have been proved in my part time jobs.I wish I could use them to sell my favorite Nestle products to more and more people!&nbsp;</p><p><span style="display:block;font-size: 13px;opacity:0.5;transform:translateY(-20px);">备案号:YXX1p6PmGN0HXLQyEwI5olY</span></p>
