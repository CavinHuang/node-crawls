  <h1>第 8 节面试最常见的七类英文问题</h1>
  <p>对外企的英文面试应该按照以下步骤来进行准备<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.预测问题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这个环节不但能帮助你克服听力困难<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而且能缓解你在面试时的紧张情绪<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.口头甚至书面准备答案<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>英语 8 级的牛人也会在英文面试时出现逻辑不清的情况<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为流利和井井有条绝对不是同义词<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>当然<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>有同学担心写下来的答案会死板<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>那么<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>口头准备亦可<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.全真模拟<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>背诵绝对不可<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>但是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>找个高手给自己做做模拟<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>绝对能大大提高你的成功概率<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>衡量英文回答是否精彩<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也只有一个标准<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答中<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>体现了申请人的什么特征<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个特征是否刚好适合所申请职位<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>Personal information:关于个人信息的问题 &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.What´s the meaning of your English name?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你的英文名字有什么含义吗<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>有些申请人的英文名字不合常规<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>比如叫 King<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>或者 Sushi<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>或者 Monk 等<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>面试官询问这些申请人名字的含义<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>主要有几个目的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>第一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>缓解面试的紧张气氛<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>第二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>面试官也有一点点好奇心<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>第三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>给申请人一个展示自己独特个性的机会<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为敢于给自己起独特名字的人往往具有独特的个性<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这些人希望引起别人的注意<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Actually<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> Sushi is my nickname<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> my friends gave me this name because I like to eat the Japanese food sushi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答体现出她是个什么样的人呢<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>爱吃寿司……虽然不会引起负面印象<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是也不会有正面印象<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I love cooking.I often make sushi for my friends<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> so they often call me<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Master Sushi<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>or just<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Sushi<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>……&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答体现出她是个什么样的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>动手能力比较强的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>喜欢做一些细节的事情……完美匹配行政<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>人力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>客服等岗位<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.What´s the meaning of your E-mail address?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你的电子邮件地址有什么寓意吗<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>当代青年男女普遍个性张扬<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以连 E-mail 地址往往也颇为独特<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>令人或迷惑或大笑的 E-mail 地址有很多<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>比如 neverlazy<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> bighead<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> lazyfish<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>52n52n<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> yulovehong<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>等等<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>与上一个问题一样<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>善于交流的面试官往往乐于给你一个机会展示自己的个性<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>52n52n<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>Oh<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it means I love you<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I love you<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> because 5 sounds like<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>I<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>in Chinese<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and 2 for<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>love<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>n<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>for<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>you<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>.I registered this address to please my girlfriend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>公开示爱<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>除了他的女朋友会觉得甜蜜蜜<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>别的人一律会反胃<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Never lazy<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>Oh<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I signed up this address in sophomore year to encourage myself never to be lazy<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> because at that time<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I realized we seemed to be spending more time watching movies and dating……haha.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>第一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>她轻描淡写地说到自己在大二就注册了这个 E-mail<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>打消了面试官觉得她临时注册这个邮箱博人眼球的那一丝疑惑<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>此外<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>在 E-mail 地址中都要给自己励志的女子<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>一定是个工作狂人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>（</span></span>这名女生如愿进入了宝洁<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>。</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.Where are you from?<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>Where is your hometown?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你是哪里人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>家乡在什么地方<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>很多老外在中国工作居住多年<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>甚至自诩中国通<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他们可能会顺便问问你是哪里人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>拉近和你的距离<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I was born and raised in the city of Wuhan.Actually<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> my home is not far from our Wuhan Office on Hantang Street……&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答说出了该公司在武汉的地址<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>展示了一下自己提前所做的功课<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Come from a very small town in the Northeast of China<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it´s still far underdeveloped<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> you know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> nothing like big cities like Beijing.The local people can only earn less than one thousand Yuan RMB per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>比较健谈<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也比较煽情<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>家乡人均 1000 元的收入会让面试官有些唏嘘<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>在潜意识里会希望帮助你<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.What are some of your hobbies?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你有哪些爱好<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>由爱好判断性格<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>老外也爱这么干<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I used to play chess a lot with my friends<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but right now my only hobby seems watching TV to relax my mind.I´ve been too busy with my work to<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>afford<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>any time for my hobby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>喜欢下棋<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是工作太忙<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以就只能看看电视放松一下——这样的忙碌形象是符合多数老板期望的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>Education:关于教育背景的问题 &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>5.Why did you select your major area of study?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你为什么选择这个专业<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>外国面试官更喜欢提<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>为什么<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的问题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他们希望申请人是一个有主见的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I was quite good at mathematics and physics back in high school<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> so I chose a related major<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> Telecommunications.I also applied for the major o.computer science<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> you know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> these two majors are the hottest these years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>擅长数学<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>自然地沟通<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>As a matter of fact<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I didn´t select the major of<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Geography Education<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>at all as I have never&nbsp;</p>
<p>wanted to be a teacher. I had chosen<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Business Administration<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>Economics<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>and<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Logistics Management<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>when I applied to study at Zhongshan University, but unfortunately I failed to get into these hottest majors as the score I got in College Entrance Examinations was about ten points less than the minimum requirement.The school<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>allocated<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>me to a cold major, Geography Education.Luckily, I could select a second major.I chose<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Public Relations Management<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>to be my minor area of study.What was that saying?<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>If God closes the door, he will open a window for you.<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答似乎很长<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是不得不这么长<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这里面有一个典型的中国特色<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>如果你的分数够不上第一志愿<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>学校就把你打入某一个<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>冷宫<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>专业去<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而你为了进入这所一流的大学不得不屈服<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这种怪现象制造出很多感觉自己比窦娥还冤的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>冤男怨女<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>学着<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>地理教育<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>却痛恨从事教师职业<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>学着<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>国际政治<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>却连国际新闻都懒得看<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>这个回答的优点在于<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>第一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>向外国面试官普及了一下中国特色<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>第二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>强调了自己对商业和管理一贯的热诚<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>第三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>告诉对方其实自己高考只差 10 分才没进最热门的专业<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>第四<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>自己是个不轻言放弃的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>主修学不成用辅修来弥补<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>第五<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>把上帝拉进来<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也显得你很幽默<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.What subjects were your favorite ones?Why?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你最喜欢的课程是什么<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>为什么<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>与中国面试官一样<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>对于应届毕业生<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>外国面试官经常问有关学业方面的问题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>面试官喜欢的申请人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>是对自己专业的优缺点能够分析得头头是道的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I like the subjects that include lots of experiments<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> for example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>CAD<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>and<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Circuit Design<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>.I found that I can learn more quickly by doing experiments than studying the theories only.I guess it´s partly because I am good with hands<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and doing experiments give me a chance to learn in a creative way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>利用课程说到自己<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>善于动手<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>和<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>有创造力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>不错<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.What subjects were your least favorite ones?Why?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>你最不喜欢的课程是什么<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>为什么<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>外国面试官往往更加辩证<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>在问完成功经历后一定要追问失败经历<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>问完喜欢什么科目之后也要问问不喜欢什么科目<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>My least favorite courses include<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Marxism<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>and<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Revolutionary History of China<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>.I don´t like these subjects not because I am not a patriot<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> actually I love my country and I am fascinated by the revolutionary history of it.However<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> these subjects turned out to be disappointments as the textbooks and the ways they were taught were nothing but a repetition of the history subjects in our secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>在回答老外面试问题的时候<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>要注意文化差异<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他可能很难理解中国学生为什么不喜欢学<span class="fw-op "><span>《</span></span>马哲<span class=" fw-cl "><span>》</span></span>和<span class="fw-op "><span>《</span></span>中国革命史<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>》</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以你需要解释一下<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这并非我们不爱国<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而是这两门课程几十年如一日的老面孔<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>学生在高中就已经学过<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>老师也不愿意对教学法进行创新<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I found<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Macroeconomics<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>and<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Microeconomics<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>disappointing as well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> for the same reason that the information fell behind the times<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> for example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the exchange rate between RMB and USD stilled remained 8.3:1 till now<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>You can imagine how disappointing we were.So I spent more time listening to the lectures on economics organized by the Student Union.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个答案更好<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为它表露出的信息是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>我热爱学习宏观与微观经济学<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>我学习兴趣很浓厚<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是很遗憾<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这两门课没有满足我对知识的渴望<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这就是典型的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>表面看是负面信息<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>实则体现了正面信息<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.Other than the courses you studied, what is the most important thing you learned from your college experience?<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>除了学习方面<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你在大学里面最大的收获是什么<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>？</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>外国面试官的思维往往非常直接<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他们往往坚持认为<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>只有在大学里面有巨大收获的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>才能在工作岗位上取得巨大收获<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>所以<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>千万不要天真地说<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>我在大学里学会了自理<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>学会了安排自己的生活<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>晕<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这是童年的成就<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>绝对不能拿到大学里面来说了<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I think the most important thing I have learnt in university is that I´ve learnt how to set appropriate goals and see them through.You know it is so easy for university students to waste time if we don´t set goals<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> so I set demanding goals to motivate myself.One is that I decided to get scholarships each year<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the other one is that I decided to be the leader of a club on campus.Neither was easy<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but in more than three years<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I managed to achieve both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这是一个很漂亮的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>体现了自己的优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>既能够给自己设立比较高的目标<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也擅长克服困难实现自己的目标<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>面试官最喜欢的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>就是这种<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>目标导向型<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的申请人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I believe the best I have achieved in university is that I´ve improved my general ability<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> for example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> presentation skill<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> question exploring<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> pressure handling and so on.Take the monitor election activity as an example.I have to develop the skill to present myself in front of 70-80 students.Through different activities<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I have made progress in leading.communication<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> organizing.This probably is the best I have achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答符合我们一贯强调的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>个性化<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>和<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>夸赞自己<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>两个原则<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>Experience:关于工作经验的问题 &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>当老外提出这个问题的时候<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他心里的疑问是——<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>这个公司我从来没有听说过<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>是不是一个小烂公司<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>如果真的是小公司<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你务必强调出个体的能力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>很明显<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个回答既体现了自己原来的公司的规模<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也暗示了自己能够适应繁忙的工作的特点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>在这个问题上<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>面试官希望捕捉的信息点是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>第一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个家伙原来干的工作和我们现在这份工作到底有多少是类似的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>第二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他原来的工作表现到底怎样<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Yes.I would arrive at office half an hour earlier as my boss often gives me a lot of work once h.comes in<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and I have to be ready for it.My responsibilities are mainly to assist the sales manager and representatives<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> e.g.order tracking<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> stock report<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> document preparation and translation<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> using Excel<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> Word and PPT.When the reps are on business trip<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I will deal with their share.Two thirds of my work i.computer involved<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> working on table and forms precisely and quickly<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the rest of time is to take care of the managers and reps<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> you know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> do what they need me to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>用事实说明自己是个敬业的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>在描述工作内容的时候<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>有细节性描述<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也有总结性描述<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>非常清晰<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I enjoy working with straightforward people<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> partly because I am a straightforward person myself.I hope my colleagues will offer their honest suggestions and even criticisms to me.Frankly speaking<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I am not ver.comfortable with those people who are too sensitive and always hesitate to express themselves. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I enjoy working with positive-minded people who don´t complain too much.I find it uncomfortable to work with those who alway.complain.In my opinion<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> we either need to make improvements or accept the facts.Complaining is a total waste of time. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这是一个令人喜欢的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为任何一个公司里都有大量的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>怨男怨女<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>令人反感却无可奈何<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>如果能多招聘几个<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>阳光男女<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>进公司<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>岂不美哉<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>回答三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I enjoy working with those who are action makers.I don´t like to work with big talkers or those who are very slow to react.I am a quick person myself<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> so I prefer to work with the people of the same kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>和上个问题一样<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>面试官希望了解的是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>第一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这份工作是否会让你满意<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>第二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你一定会效仿你的老板<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>如果你说自己喜欢的老板是能吃苦耐劳的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>那么你往往是一个吃苦耐劳的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>如果你说喜欢自己的老板是高屋建瓴的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>那么你往往也是一个颇为注重宏观规划的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>要格外注意的是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>如果面试你的人恰恰就是你未来的老板<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>那么这个问题可要小心了<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>如果你的描述和他的个性风马牛不相及<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>可能令面试功亏一篑<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I like democratic bosses.He or she can give me enough room to develop myself<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> rather than giving instructions to me on every small detail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答比较危险<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>明显地表现出该申请人追求<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>自由化<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的性格特点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>会令很多面试官觉得心里一沉<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>所以说<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>在回答这个问题的时候<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>要走<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>保守主义<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>路线<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>尽量不要给人一种<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>初生牛犊不怕虎<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的感觉<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而要表现出谦虚谨慎<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>积极<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>诚恳等特点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>再者说<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个回答明显在跟老板提要求<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>当你对比下面这个回答二的时候<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你就会明白一个道理<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>给老板提要求<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>远远不如请老板给自己提要求令人喜欢<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Ideal boss<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I prefer strict bosses.Although working with strict bosses means a lot of pressure<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I can grow fast with them.For a new graduate<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> nothing is more important than developing our abilities as fast as we can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>主动请老板为自己加压<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>多么可爱可敬的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>善哉<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>工作经验有所欠缺的申请人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>不妨向面试官表表这样的态度<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Ideal boss<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>Let me see.Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> in my opinion<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> an ideal boss can effectively motivate his or her subordinates by encouraging good performances and punishing poor performances.I will feel highly motivated to do a good job if I know my boss would reward me if my performance is excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>好<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>一个希望老板能<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>奖惩分明<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的员工<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>往往是很自信<span class=" fw-cl "><span>、</span></span>能够有优良表现的员工<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>The worst aspect of my last job is definitely lack of job security.My pay was delayed twice in the four months I work here.I joined thi.company in hope of helping the boss to grow a small business into a bigger one.However<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it proved a lot more difficult than I expected.The boss is very reluctant to invest in promotion.As a result<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> business has been rather slow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个问题相当棘手<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>太真实可能会吓坏面试官<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>太虚伪又没法令人相信<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>比较好的应对方式是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>给对方列举一些非致命的失败<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>同时<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这些失败的原因是自己所定的目标比较高<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这个回答很圆滑<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为他所有的失败都是在基于高标准严要求之下的吹毛求疵的失败<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>整个答案给我们的感觉不是在说失败<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而是在暗示面试官<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>我是个对自己有很高要求的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以我自然会有一些比较失望的地方<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I failed to achieve the sales target last year<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I sold a million and a half but the target was two million.This year<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I´ve done 70%of the target<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but I´m afraid I still can´t meet the target as our Beijing headquarter is having some problems and can´t provide effective pre-sales support for us.Failing to reach the target is a big disappointment for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am very proud of the progress I made in my last job.I joined th.company as a new hand<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but after only a year and half<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I was promoted to be a team leader.I could achieve such a rapid progress partly because my last job is in a small firm.If I can make the same progress in a larg.company like GE<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I would be prouder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I would give myself 70 if 100 is full satisfaction.I had some achievements in my last job.For example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I got B in annual evaluation last year<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> which was top 40%.The promotion program I organized on Beijing Road was highly successful and my client was very pleased.However<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the results of several other programs were not quite satisfactory due to some reasons I couldn´t control.Actually that´s why I want to quit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>平庸的人往往感受不到压力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>有能力的人往往在工作中遭遇很大的压力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>同时<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他们处理压力的方法也是相当积极有效的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>In my last job<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> most pressur.comes from the high sales target.It´s extremely difficult to meet the target as it´s 30%increase over the sales of last year<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and the sales of last year was already quite high.However<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I can manage this pressure well because<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> although I can´t meet the sales target<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> my sales abilities have never been challenged by my boss and others.Six out of seven sales reps can´t meet the target this year and I am actually quite close to the target.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>虽然该申请人没有说出具体的应对压力的办法<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是他告诉面试官他并不受压力所困<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为自己的能力早已经被公认<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这是一个很自信的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I have to meet deadlines in my last job.Some projects have a very tight schedule<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and even if we do a lot of over time work it´s still hard to meet the deadline.This gives me a lot of pressure.Usually I manage the pressure b.communicating honestly with my boss.If he can understand me I would feel relaxed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>非常入情入理的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>做技术工作的人员通常为了赶项目而熬通宵<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而如果熬通宵也不能如期交付项目的话<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>势必会造成心理压力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>争取老板的理解<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>的确是缓解压力的好办法<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这是个超级棒的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>它变相地告诉面试官<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>自己是最资深的客户服务代表<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因此总是被派作<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>消防队队员<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>自然要面临很大的压力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>而自信<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>是应对压力的最好办法<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>My career choice actually has been influenced a lot by my mother.She´s been a Admin&amp;HR director in a large state-owne.company for over twenty years.She impressed on me<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>注释<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>反复强调<span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>that HR jobs are suitable for women as it´s not influenced much by age<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and females enjoy an equal opportunity of being promoted.However<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the other top positions like sales often go to men.Besides family influence<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I select this job also becauseI feel I am suitable to it.I´m easy-going<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> trusted by others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这是一个很好的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>真实<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>又夸奖了自己<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>告诉对方自己的家庭很支持自己从事这个职业<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>的确有加分的作用<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I want to be a Sales Rep as it suits my expectations.First of all<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I wish to get a pay based on my performance<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> you know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> better results<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> better pay.Secondly<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I hope I will be going out<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> meeting people instead of sitting in office.What´s more<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> sales.compared to other jobs can improve my abilities most quickly.I can learn how to observe others<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> how to persist<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> how to deal with coldness and rejection<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and all these traits will help me to be successful in both career and personal life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>非常好地概括了销售工作的优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>体现了一个应届毕业生的活力和激情<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I think I´m qualified because the job duties of this position are 80%same as my last job.And the rest 20%shouldn´t be a big problem because I´m quick to learn<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and eager to learn.My ability to learn has been proved in my last job as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>这是一个典型的标准答案<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>首先要把自己符合招聘启事的地方强调一下<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>其次要把不足之处弥补一下<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>关键得分点在于<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你使用的是<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>过去时<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>要用过去的经历来说明问题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而不是告诉面试官未来我会怎样的这种<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>将来时<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I would be doing similar things as in my last job but with a higher salary in a more famou.company.That´s the main attraction of this position to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>The best of this job<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I think<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> is that it gives me an opportunity to become a professional in the shortest time.I can master the expertise of auditing with th.comprehensive trainings.Learning a professional skill is particularly important to me as my major of Business English is a tool instead of a career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>大公司通常为自己完善的培训体系而自豪<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而应届毕业生也恰恰最需要这样的培训<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以说<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这是个典型的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>一拍即合<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>唯一的缺点就是它可能过于大众化<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这个申请人做得就很好<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他把自己的大学专业结合在答案中<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>他告诉面试官<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>自己所学的英语专业不能算是一种职业<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>只能是为某个职业而服务的工具<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>所以一份专业性强的工作对他来说格外有吸引力<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I know the obvious disadvantage of this job for most people in this industry is the long hours of work to meet the deadline.My friend told me she ever sat in front o.computer for 36 hours without eating proper meals and sleep……but<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I am sure I can deal with it.My mind always seemed quicker at night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>只有外国面试官会这样提问<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为他不了解中国的国情<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>在中国<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>有两类母亲<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>一类是传统型的中国妇女<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>从来不会夸奖自己的孩子<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>另一类是高学历的现代母亲<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>因为只有一个孩子而看不到孩子的任何缺点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>在面试中<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你不妨把中国的这种<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>文化<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>传递给面试官<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>以使面试气氛更加轻松有趣<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it´s an interesting question.It reminds me of a Chinese saying<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the best child is your own child<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and the best wife is others´wife.It means a man or woman is always satisfied with the child<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but not with the spouse.My mother is just like this.She tells everybody that I am hard-working<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> more hard-working than I should be.She says I am trustable and independent<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> never giving her troubles<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> you know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> she sent me to boarding school at 14.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答八<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am passionate about work because I can find lots of fun at work<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> say<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> making an achievement<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> being praised by boss especially in public<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> or self-improvement.For example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I´ve volunteered to be an Internal Trainer at ou.company to train new staff.Although I make little money for my hard work I´ve gained more important things than money<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> like presentation skills and confidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答九<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>My strength is that I am sensitive to what´s happening around<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> in other words<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I pay attention to what´s going on and think about it.I keep up with the latest fashions in our business.For example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I once suggested one of my clients to sell NBA cards and he made around ten thousand Yuan from this business in less than a month.I hit on the idea when my nephew told me many of his classmates were interested in these cards.For another example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> an old client once rejected my invitations of dinner three times in a row<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and I immediately got a feeling that he was trying to hide something from me.So I visited him the next day and found out that he intended to cooperate with another sports shoe.company.I successfully stopped him from breaking from us by giving him some real examples of failures of this brand.I believe I have to be sensitive to the business and to people or I can´t do my work well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答十<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I have problem solving skills<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> that is<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I can often think of a way to bring a satisfying end to a difficult situation.Let me give you an example at workplace.Last summer I found a very obvious number mistake made by the Project Manager when I was a part time auditor.I would have told her directly if she hadn´t lost her temper for the same kind of mistake made by another auditor.So<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> come out with an idea that wouldn´t have made it too embarrassing for her.I sent her an E-mail<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> not only reporting the mistake of the number<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but asking a lot of questions about that project.As a result she realized her mistake and didn´t feel very bad because she was still an expert who could answer my difficult questions<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>具有解决问题的能力<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这是一个令面试官很感兴趣的优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他将很乐意与你讨论你是如何解决问题的<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答十一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am quite innovative.I would rather make a birthday card than buy one.My family likes the special dishes I cook.I´ve planned about half of the parties in my class<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> the<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>Mock Intervie.competition<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>party proved so successful that it´s been followed by many other classes.Last year I helped a MP3 shop owner to build a sales channel in our school.He is a relative of my classmate.When he asked us to hand out some advertisement sheets on campus<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I told him that this is not at all an effective way of getting sales<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and it might lead to a big fine for paper pollution because students litter this kind of sheets.I suggested that he hire some student agents among freshmen and sophomore as freshmen are the target customers and sophomore are keen to do some part time jobs to make some extra money and to prove themselves.This suggestion proved very effective<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>what´s more<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it even gets support from our school because it is seen as a way of social practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>有创新思维<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的确是个优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>不过<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>我并不建议应届毕业生过多地强调自己的创造性思维<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>用人单位往往更喜欢听到诸如<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>脚踏实地<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>兢兢业业<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>责任感强<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>等优点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>原因很简单<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>应届毕业生谈创新<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>往往停留在空谈的阶段<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答十二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I have a great sense of responsibility<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> to the society and to my work.For example I would shout when I saw a thief putting his hand in others´bags<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> though I only had one chance to do so because I had only witnessed stealing once.I report water leaking in public places immediately.And I really dislike some girls for flushing the toilet before use though it looks clean.I don´t think such people will make good employees<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> because if they lack responsibility for the society they won´t be responsible for their work.I am always responsible for my work<span class=" fw-cl "><span>；</span></span>if I don´t do it to my best I will feel guilty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>责任感强<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>好哇<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>只要能够有效证明自己的责任感的确很强<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个优点永远能为你增色不少<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答十三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am persistent.I keep a diary sinc.coming to college.I eat healthy food and exercise as much as possible all these years.I worked for one student organization for three years instead of participating in many organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答十四<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am good with my hands<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> as my parents put it<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I have smart hands.At home it is my job to deal with all the minor troubles of water<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> electricity and gas utilities.At university I´ve scored very well on experiment courses.I am good at web design and I´ve brought some of my designs with me today if you are interested.I believe I have advantages over some other candidates because I am good at dealing with machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>中国面试官往往用这个提问来衡量申请人是否有自知之明或者开诚布公的勇气<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>外国面试官则往往更加注重这个问题的<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>后续问题<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>也就是——<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>你将如何避免因自己的缺点而影响工作质量<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am not a great public speaker.When speaking in public I feel uncomfortable unless the topic is familiar.So I have to be well prepared before giving a presentation.As a matter of fact<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I did lots of preparation for our interview today<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>不善于在公开场合发表演讲<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>的确是很多人的通病<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>不过<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>现在越来越多的申请人<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>喜欢<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>上了这个回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>造成了人力资源经理们的审美疲劳<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>我建议大家在这个答案上适当包装<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个申请人做得就很好<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他打趣说自己来面试前都做了详尽的准备<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>无疑会博得面试官展颜一笑<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> maybe my weakness sounds a little bit strange to you.I think my weakness is that I talk too much.I like to express my opinions.My classmates say I am bossy and like to show off.I´ve also noticed that I don´t listen enough because I am talking too much.So I write down a reminder on my notebook<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>Listen more, speak less.<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>But interestingly enough<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> even when I feel I am speaking little my co-workers still pat on my shoulder and say<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>Susan, you are an active person!<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>The<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>talker<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>impression doesn´t go away easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>说话太多<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>甚至有点爱出风头<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>其实是一个比较可爱的缺点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>至少<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>比招聘一个闷嘴葫芦要强上百倍啊<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I pride myself on being a big picture guy<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but I have to admit I am not careful enough.Sometimes I make stupid date and number errors<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> like typing 2004 when it´s 2005<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>Once I forgot to final-check the microphone when I was in charge of the Welcome Party and caused great panic when it was found to be silent only half an hour before the show began.So I do love to hang out with the<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>detail<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>persons.They can depend on me to make plans<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and I can depend on them to remind me of the small details.When I can´t depend on others<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I always depend on my notebook.I like to write things down in my notebook now<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> which is the best way to remember every important detail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>能看到事情的大框架<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>有全局观而忽视了细节<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>确实有很多这样的人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这个回答的亮点不在于此<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而在于他对自己缺点的弥补手段<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>一方面他乐于和注重细节的人合作<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>另一方面他选择使用<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>好记性不如烂笔头<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>的方法强迫自己注重细节<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>不错<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答四<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I do things in haste sometimes.I am eager to finish a task once I start doing it.It looks like strength but it can be a big weakness at work.Haste makes waste.Great haste makes great waste.For example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> when I started working for my current boss last year I once made a ridiculous mistake in an urgent report.I typed<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>shit out<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>instead of<span class="fw-op "><span>「</span></span>try to<span class=" fw-cl "><span>」</span></span>for the two phrases have exactly the same spelling.So now I often remind myself<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Do it right<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> Don´t do it over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答五<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I set unrealistic goals sometimes.For example<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> lose 10kg in a month<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> or finish typing a form in an hour.The truth is that I know they are hard to achieve even when I am setting them<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but I can´t resist doing so for I need to be motivated by aiming high.But my boss sometimes criticizes me for being unrealistic when making plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>设立不切实际的目标<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>的确是个缺点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>不过<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>往往上进心强的人才会有这种缺点<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答六<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>Well<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> frankly speaking<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I think I still need to be more professional.Sometimes I let my emotions affect my work.Last winter I lost a client because I didn´t look very enthusiastic when answering the inquiries of a potential client.He went to another teller the next day when he opened an account in our bank.And he bought ten thousand Yuan Lideying<span class="fw-op "><span>（</span></span>a investment fund<span class=" fw-cl "><span>）</span></span>immediately.This was a big lesson for me<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it made me realize that I should learn to be at my best to any client<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> at any time.You know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> always look like an angel<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> no matter how difficult it is<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> because it will indeed help me to sell more products.You never know when the customers decide to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>通常<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>告诉面试官自己的职业化程度还不够高是非常危险的做法<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>但是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个申请人以最真诚的态度<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>给了我们一个很打动人的回答<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>使得她在一群对自己的缺点欲说还休的申请人中脱颖而出<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答七<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am too sensitive and spend too much time worrying about what others think about me.For example I hesitate to speak out when I disagree with someone in fear of making him uncomfortable.So I have missed some chances to share my views and prove my abilities.I wish I could be more objective and more straightforward when dealing with people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答八<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>My weakness is that I need pressure to work harder.This is my weak point.I tend to perform better when somebody is pushing me<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> or give me a high goal.I really wish I can work with a very strict boss so he can give me the pressure I need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span><span class="fw-op fw--collapsed"><span>「</span></span>需要压力才能更努力<span class=" fw-cl fw--collapsed"><span>」</span></span><span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这是大家的通病啊<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>这个回答的点睛之处在于<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>该申请人盼望着能遇上一个高标准严要求的老板<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>从而督促自己更加努力地工作<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这是一个多么可爱的令用人单位求之不得的应届毕业生啊<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答九<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I am likely to be influenced by the environment.I study hard when I find everybody else studying hard<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and I start looking for a part-time job when I find others talking about how important it is<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>It would be great if I could join Ericsson<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> as I can be influenced by the high quality people here<span class=" fw-cl "><span>！</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>问题分析<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>与中国面试官相比<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>老外更加重视这个问题<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>在这个问题上<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>面试官捕捉的信息点是<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>第一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个家伙是个有计划有目标的人吗<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>第二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他对自己所申请的职业了解吗<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>他知道这个职位的下一步是什么吗<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>第三<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>这个家伙所设立的职业目标切合实际吗<span class=" fw-cl "><span>？</span></span>此外<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>外国面试官往往是你未来的直线经理或者顶头上司<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>与人力资源部的面试官相比<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>他更希望遇到一个已经明确决定要在这个领域里发展的申请人<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>In five years I want to be a brand manager<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> or<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> a marketing specialist.As a matter of fact<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I don´t really care what title I will have<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> because you know<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it´s too soon to tell now.But<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I´m sure about what I´ll be doing at that time.I want to be able to independently handle different kinds of promotion campaigns<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> make effective use of media<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> and find out any other means to promote a product or service.That´s where I see myself doing in five years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>点评<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>在小公司里<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>获得一个高职位往往很容易<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>如果是在大公司求职<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>你可以尽量淡化对高职位的向往<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span>而强调对工作内容本身的追求<span class=" fw-cl "><span>。</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答一<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I expect to have a salary between 4000 and 5000 as this is the average salary the students of our school can get.But we can negotiate on it anyway.As a new graduate I care about career development opportunities more than the starting salary.As to the salary in five years<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> frankly speaking<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I´ve even thought about it.I hope the more the better<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> but of course<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> it depends on what I can do for th.company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>回答二<span class=" fw-cl "><span>：</span></span>I make about 4000 Yuan RMB now and I expect a salary from 5000 to 6000.It´s not so easy to tell how much I can make in five years.If I am still at the same position I don´t think the salary then will be too much different<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> however<span class=" fw-cl "><span>，</span></span> I certainly hope I can do more important things for Adidas and then be offered a higher pay.&nbsp;</p>
